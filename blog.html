            <p>The Manpower Employment Outlook Survey conducted in June 2005 forecast positive employment prospects for
                the
                July-September quarter of 2005. Carried out for the first time in India, the survey is based on
                interviews
                with 2,488 employers across the country.
                According to Mr. Soumen Basu, Chairman of Manpower India, the aim of the study is to create awareness
                and
                provide a research base to the employers. Mr. Basu said in June 2005 that a copy of his report would be
                given to the Planning Commission.
                The sectors covered under the survey are: finance, insurance, and real estate; manufacturing; mining and
                construction; public administration and education; services; transportation and utilities; and wholesale
                and
                retail trade.</p><br>
            <p>Employers in the services sector, including the information technology and IT-enabled sector, indicated
                the
                highest demand for an increase of 44 percent employees, followed by finance, insurance and real estate
                at 41
                percent, Growth in the transport and utilities industry would be just 17 percent.
                The sectors surveyed include the private and public sector undertaking and industrial houses with a
                significant contribution to gross domestic product (GDP). Fully based on inputs from the organized
                sector,
                the survey included multinational companies also.
                The Manpower Employment Outlook Survey is conducted quarterly to measure employers’ intention to
                increase or
                decrease the number of employees in their workforce during the next quarter.
                The employment field in India has undergone and is undergoing a sea change with a wide range of
                opportunities open to youngsters in various fields. Never before in India’s history have we seen such an
                interaction between the employers and the potential employees. It has been a two-way street. MNCs,
                manufacturing concerns. IT majors, IT- enabled services and others need the right kind of professionals
                and
                others as much as the youngsters need the right kind of openings in different fields.</p><br>
            <p>The old kind of recruitment is passed. Gone are the days when one applies for a job and waits eternally
                for
                an interview, medical examination and other unending formalities. Today interviews are fixed just on the
                basis of ads or even through walk in interviews or teleconferencing. And there are campus selections and
                career fairs organized at regular intervals in different cities.
                Institutions-both government and private-are offering courses in subjects off the beaten track. Everyone
                knows that change is the only constant factor and survival depends upon acting or reacting to the way
                winds
                blow in the fields of education and job opportunities.
                Did we ever dream just two decades ago that job avenues would be opening up through sheer knowledge
                management and reduction in interaction costs? The New Millennium optimizes talent globally through
                remote
                services. Any activity that does not require face-to-face interaction between a service and its receiver
                is
                good for remote processing. The market potential for remote service is currently around $120 billion and
                is
                expected to grow to a whopping $250 billion.
                IT-enabled services promise a million jobs a year and web-based business models will mould the future,
                throwing up widening horizons for outsourcing operations that would be managed remotely. An unending,
                vast
                territory is open for you-medical transcription, data entry, design services, accounting and financial
                services, network management, research services, data search and analysis, website services, monitoring
                services, secretarial services and the like.</p><br>
            <p>Some of the fresh avenues of employment that have emerged in recent times have been medical
                transcription,
                call centers based on business process outsourcing, insurance claim processing, back office operations,
                etc.
                Many companies are employing graduates fresh from colleges or universities, training and orienting them
                to
                meet the demands of the jobs that they are required to perform. The universities must change according
                to
                the changing demands of the times, the needs of industry and needs of employment potential. Let the
                syllabus
                be modified to help the students find jobs of the ‘new wave’.
                Compared to a mere 75,000 software engineers emerging in the US, a top high 1.2 lakh software
                professional
                enter the employment field in India every year. The number of low-end software technicians has already
                crossed a million. The software industry is growing at the rate of 50 percent per annum and IT exports
                account for 30 percent of the total exports. And there is a rush for IT-MBAs.
                We no longer talk of just hospitals, but talk only in terms of multi- specialty hospitals and such
                hospitals
                that pay hefty salary to the specialists are mushrooming in big and small cities. With tourism of
                different
                brands like ecotourism, pilgrimage tourism and heritage tourism, we have added one more brand-health
                tourism.</p>
